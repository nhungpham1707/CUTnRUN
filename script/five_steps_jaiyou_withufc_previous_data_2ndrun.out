AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /hpc/pmc_drost/PROJECTS/SMARCB1_reexpression_JH/ATAC/previous_samples/Myc06_luciferase/Myc06_luciferase_R2.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
