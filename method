Raw data files that passed quality control had their adapters trimmed with trim galore (v.0.65) and subsequently aligned against human genome hg38 with Gencode v. 37 annotation using bowtie2. --> done!

Thereafter, Picard Tools was used to sort aligned files using the SortSam function and then to remove sequencing duplicates using the MarkDuplicates function. --> done!

These files were then used as input for macs2 to detect peaks using the macs2 tool. For that, the callpeak function was used to identify narrow peaks in each replicate per experimental condition (i.e., fusion, luciferase and tfe3); in each group, controls were defined as the matched H3K4Me3 sample, with a q-value cutoff of 0.01. --> done!

Bigwig files were generated using the bamCoverage function from deeptools package (v. 3.5.1) after merging all .bam files belonging to each experimental condition. --> done!


Heatmaps were generated with plotHeatmap function from the same package.


To identify differential peaks across conditions, aligned data and peak files were loaded into Rstudio (v. 4.2.1) and analyzed with the package DiffBind (v. 3.8.1). Differential analysis was performed by taking into consideration the different conditions in the contrast design. Differential peaks were selected based on an FDR < 0.05 and fold change >2 or fold change < 0. 

Peak regions were annotated using the ChIPSeeker (v. 1.34.0) package. 

Enrichment analyses were performed with the ClusterProfiler (v. 4.6.0) package.

Finally, motifs were identified by converting the peak regions to .fasta format and uploaded into the STREME tool available in the MEME suite to identify enriched motifs in each condition. To identify which transcription factors may bind to these motifs, the Tomtom tool, also available in the MEME suite, was used.
