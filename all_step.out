	Program will find de novo and known motifs in regions in the genome

	Usage: findMotifsGenome.pl <pos file> <genome> <output directory> [additional options]
	Example: findMotifsGenome.pl peaks.txt mm8r peakAnalysis -size 200 -len 8

	Possible Genomes:
			-- or --
		Custom: provide the path to genome FASTA files (directory or single file)
			Heads up: will create the directory "preparsed/" in same location.

	Basic options:
		-mask (mask repeats/lower case sequence, can also add 'r' to genome, i.e. mm9r)
		-bg <background position file> (genomic positions to be used as background, default=automatic)
			removes background positions overlapping with target positions unless -keepOverlappingBg is used
			-chopify (chop up large background regions to the avg size of target regions)
		-len <#>[,<#>,<#>...] (motif length, default=8,10,12) [NOTE: values greater 12 may cause the program
			to run out of memory - in these cases decrease the number of sequences analyzed (-N),
			or try analyzing shorter sequence regions (i.e. -size 100)]
		-size <#> (fragment size to use for motif finding, default=200)
			-size <#,#> (i.e. -size -100,50 will get sequences from -100 to +50 relative from center)
			-size given (uses the exact regions you give it)
		-S <#> (Number of motifs to optimize, default: 25)
		-mis <#> (global optimization: searches for strings with # mismatches, default: 2)
		-norevopp (don't search reverse strand for motifs)
		-nomotif (don't search for de novo motif enrichment)
		-rna (output RNA motif logos and compare to RNA motif database, automatically sets -norevopp)

	Scanning sequence for motifs
		-find <motif file> (This will cause the program to only scan for motifs)

	Known Motif Options/Visualization
		-mset <vertebrates|insects|worms|plants|yeast|all> (check against motif collects, default: auto)
		-basic (just visualize de novo motifs, don't check similarity with known motifs)
		-bits (scale sequence logos by information content, default: doesn't scale)
		-nocheck (don't search for de novo vs. known motif similarity)
		-mcheck <motif file> (known motifs to check against de novo motifs,
		-float (allow adjustment of the degeneracy threshold for known motifs to improve p-value[dangerous])
		-noknown (don't search for known motif enrichment, default: -known)
		-mknown <motif file> (known motifs to check for enrichment,
		-nofacts (omit humor)
		-seqlogo (use weblogo/seqlogo/ghostscript to generate logos, default uses SVG now)

	Sequence normalization options:
		-gc (use GC% for sequence content normalization, now the default)
		-cpg (use CpG% instead of GC% for sequence content normalization)
		-noweight (no CG correction)
		Also -nlen <#>, -olen <#>, see homer2 section below.

	Advanced options:
		-h (use hypergeometric for p-values, binomial is default)
		-N <#> (Number of sequences to use for motif finding, default=max(50k, 2x input)
		-local <#> (use local background, # of equal size regions around peaks to use i.e. 2)
		-redundant <#> (Remove redundant sequences matching greater than # percent, i.e. -redundant 0.5)
		-maxN <#> (maximum percentage of N's in sequence to consider for motif finding, default: 0.7)
		-maskMotif <motif file1> [motif file 2]... (motifs to mask before motif finding)
		-opt <motif file1> [motif file 2]... (motifs to optimize or change length of)
		-rand (randomize target and background sequences labels)
		-ref <peak file> (use file for target and background - first argument is list of peak ids for targets)
		-oligo (perform analysis of individual oligo enrichment)
		-dumpFasta (Dump fasta files for target and background sequences for use with other programs)
		-preparse (force new background files to be created)
		-preparsedDir <directory> (location to search for preparsed file and/or place new files)
		-keepFiles (keep temporary files)
		-fdr <#> (Calculate empirical FDR for de novo discovery #=number of randomizations)

	homer2 specific options:
		-homer2 (use homer2 instead of original homer, default)
